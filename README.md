•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was solving in the projects for this course was how to logically implement a sorting algorithm using as little memory possible.  The different algorithms each had different uses and applying them to a project to get the fastest outcome was the main problem of the course.

•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached this problem by examining each data structure, and then analyzing both what would be best, and what I could realistically implement.  I decided functional code was the most important outcome.

•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
To overcome roadblocks, I used the tutoring services provided by SNHU.  This reassured me that I was on the right track as well as helping me get unstuck.

•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project helped solidify my C++ knowledge.  By having a difficult task and having to approach it different ways I ended up learning more about the language in general.

•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project helped me be adaptable because I could reuse some of the coded while implementing different data structures.  Knowing what I could copy over and what could be rewritten made coding the final easier.
